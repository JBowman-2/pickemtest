    <h2>KingBellys Pick'em</h2>

  
    <h3 class="tag">Kingbellys Pick'em is a great way to stay excited about football, without having to put in the time that traditional Fanatasy Football requires. Basically you just pick the teams that you think are going to win and cross your fingers. </h3>

    <h4>Weekly Play</h4>
    <p>Another advantange is it doesn't take a full season commitment. Each week is like starting over and has a winner, so if you miss a week its not as big of a deal. <strong>Weekly play cost $2 and its winner take all, so the more people who play the bigger the payout.</strong> </p>

   
    
    
    <h4>Season Jackpot</h4>
    <p>As an added bonus there is a season jackpot option. The Season jackpot will go to whoever has the most correct picks for the entire regular NFL season. This score will be the total number of correct picks for your best 14 weeks of the season so if you have a few bad weeks or forget make your picks you are still in the running for the Jackpot. <strong>The season jackpot is an additional 1 time payment of $10 and is also winner take all, so the more people who play the bigger the jackpot. To be included in the season jackpot the entrance payment needs to be paid by the start of the 4th week - September 26th. </strong> </p>
